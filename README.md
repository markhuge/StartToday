> Portable, actionable lists that don't suck


## Abstract

- I need a TODO/Reminder list app that works on all my devices and has an open API.
- Other people probably need this too.
- People have different workflows.
- Compromising on your workflow to use a "good-enough" tool sucks.
- Let's make something open that you can customize for your workflow.
